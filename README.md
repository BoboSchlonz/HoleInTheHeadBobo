# History of Trepanation

Trepanation, the act of drilling a hole into oneâ€™s skull, is an old surgical procedure, perhaps the first one performed frequently, dating back 7,000 to 10,000 years. The operation is well documented in Europe, Africa, Asia and Meso- and South America. In ancient cultures it was performed for alleged mystical or religious reasons (e.g. demonic possession), but also to treat insanity, severe headaches and other chronic conditions. It is estimated that in some populations up to 6% of people were trepaned. <sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> The procedure is still performed today, for both medical and non-medical reasons. 


## Trepanation in different cultures

There is much speculation as to why ancient civilizations used trepanation as it was performed without head trauma - and still is. However, it is almost certain that all those who practiced it did so because they somehow connected the brain with behavior. Some anthropologists suspect that trepanation was performed as part of tribal or superstitious rituals. Other researchers believe that the procedure was used to treat diseases such as headaches, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and mental disorders. These were probably attributed to possession by evil demons, so that a hole in the skull would have provided an escape opportunity for demons. Some suspect that trepanation was used specifically to treat skull fractures with depression, and there is historical evidence that it was used for medical reasons. The reasons for trepanning and the instruments used for the procedure vary over time and from culture to culture.

The first and second specimen of a trepned skull where found in France in 1685 ans 1816. These first findings 
Not much attention was paid to these first finds, the holes in the skull where assumed to be battle wounds.
But many later findings of individual trepanned skulls or mass graves with up to 40 trepanned skulls pointed to the fact that the holes were man-made.

## Trepanation in the 1960s and today

Today, doctors still routinely use trepanation for traumatic brain injuries. In the 1960s and 1970s a great interest in methods for "opening the mind" and increasing perception and insight developed. Mostly this was tried pharmacologically, with LSD, marijuana, peyote and other hallucinogens. However, a much smaller group chose (additionally) trepanation, a more definitive approach in response to this need. Trepanation to improve brain function is still performed on dozens of people today. In fact, there are institutions that facilitate access to it and promote research on this topic. Current interest in trepanation exists in both North America and Europe. 
The greatest advocate of trepanation for non-medical purposes is a Dutchman named Bart Hughes, who claims that the procedure can be used to achieve a higher state of consciousness. 

### Bart Hughes
Bart Hughes studied medicine, like his father, but never graduated because he failed an exam. Huges had long been interested in trepanation as a method to overcome psychological problems and reach a higher level of consciousness. The theory was based on the concept that an infant's supposedly higher state of consciousness is related to its unsealed skull, which allows the brain to expand freely and thus the cerebral blood flow and metabolism. As we grow older, the bones of the skull grow together and the flow is restricted, additionally due to our upright posture. Huges successfully trepaned himself with an electric drill on 6 January 1965. He affirmed the beneficial effects were immediate: his consciousness was sharpened and his neuroses were overcome.

He began to preach about trepanation and started publishing documents about it. His first publication was a scroll, named "The Mechanism of Brainbloodvolume ('BBV')" (also known as "Homo Sapiens Correctus") in 1964. In this he explained his theory, that because of mans upright position, the sealed cranial sutures and the fact that blood is heavier than cerebrospinal fluid, the brailbloodvolume decreases. This leads to a slowed down brainmetabolism and diminishing of creativity, originality and youth. In his theory, trepanation could be used to enhance brain functionality by balancing the proportion of blood and cerebral spinal fluid. He also introduces several other methods to increase cerebral blood flow, such as jumping, the transition from a hot tub to a cold one, yoga headstand or the use of psychoactive drugs ("psychovitamins"), with Trepanation allowing a lasting increase in blood volume and restoring pulsation and metabolism as a result of increased cranial compliance. 
The publication "Trepanation the cure for psychosis" which was publicated in 1970 was another 

# Transcoding
Please include a general description of the role of transcoding in your project. Using the H2 headings below, you can specify individual Transcoding experiments. Think about your motivations in transcoding, and mention the role of tools (also those made during the assignment). This gives some direction to the reader about what they will read in more detail below. 

## Transcoding No. 1
### Description
Short description here. You can structure the information and documentation for each transcoding, design research or coding tool as you like. It's important that you make clear the aims & goals of the transcoding, what methods and tools you use. If this is often the same across different transcodings, consider making a standardised table at the beginning of each.

You should include well-formatted documentation of your experiments and developments below. Someone without previous knowledge about your work should be able to follow along the steps, aims and results of your developments from this structure. Make sure all media used is correctly linked or embedded (images, PDFs, Videos, etc). 

### Methods
Description of your methods, documentation of behind-the-scenes processes can go here. Think of the photos and videos you made when visiting the IISG or during captures of your artefact. You can use tools such as [Gifs.com](https://gifs.com/) to generate moving-image thumbnail to link to short videos.Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.  

With some HTML tags you can do simple styling in markdown, for example:

    <width="50%">
[<img src="https://j.gifs.com/ROJr3z.gif" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/o2rmmqxC4NU)

Remember to include the url link to jump to the full media, of course! 


### Tools 
Mention the tools that you used or made (if and when relevant). 

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool 
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc. 

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for. 

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here. 

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  
 

# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below. 

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible. 

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored. 

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion 
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :) 

## Bibliography
Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work.
