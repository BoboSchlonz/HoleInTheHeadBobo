### History of Trepanation

Trepanation, the act of drilling a hole into one’s skull, is an old surgical procedure, perhaps the first one performed frequently, dating back 7,000 to 10,000 years. The operation is well documented in Europe, Africa, Asia and Meso- and South America. In ancient cultures it was performed for alleged mystical or religious reasons (e.g. demonic possession), but also to treat insanity, severe headaches and other chronic conditions. It is estimated that in some populations up to 6% of people were trepaned. <sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> The procedure is still performed today, for both medical and non-medical reasons. 


### Trepanation in different cultures

There is much speculation as to why ancient civilizations used trepanation as it was performed without head trauma - and still is. However, it is almost certain that all those who practiced it did so because they somehow connected the brain with behavior. Some anthropologists suspect that trepanation was performed as part of tribal or superstitious rituals. Other researchers believe that the procedure was used to treat diseases such as headaches, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and mental disorders. These were probably attributed to possession by evil demons, so that a hole in the skull would have provided an escape opportunity for demons. Some suspect that trepanation was used specifically to treat skull fractures with depression, and there is historical evidence that it was used for medical reasons. The reasons for trepanning and the instruments used for the procedure vary over time and from culture to culture.

The first and second specimen of a trepaned skull where found in France in 1685 and 1816. Not much attention was paid to these first finds, the holes in the skull where assumed to be battle wounds. But many later findings of individual trepanned skulls or mass graves with up to 40 trepanned skulls pointed to the fact that the holes were man-made.

### Trepanation in the 1960s and today

Today, doctors still routinely use trepanation for traumatic brain injuries. In the 1960s and 1970s a great interest in methods for "opening the mind" and increasing perception and insight developed. Mostly this was tried pharmacologically, with LSD, marijuana, peyote and other hallucinogens. However, a much smaller group chose (additionally) trepanation, a more definitive approach in response to this need. Trepanation to improve brain function is still performed on dozens of people today. 
The greatest advocate of trepanation for non-medical purposes is a Dutchman named Bart Hughes, who claims that the procedure can be used to achieve a higher state of consciousness. 

#### Bart Hughes
Bart Hughes was a scientist, a medical student, the son and grandson of doctors and is said to have discovered the mechanism behind getting high in 1962. 
Bart was first given acid in 1958 as a medical student as part of a psychiatric experiment. Gradually moving in the company of the Bohemians of that time, he started smoking pot, having first established, that it is not toxic and that he did not become addicted. He became an enthusiastic smoker and began advocating it to his medical colleagues. When he and his wife had a daughter, they called her Maria Juana. His advocacy of marijuana towards his medical colleagues gained him a bad reputation and later his flat was raided by the police looking for weed. This was reported in the newspapers, which did nothing to improve his image. A top professor of the psychiatry university of Amsterdam who previously asked him to become his assistant, now told him there was no place for him to practice in the whole city. <sup>[[2]](#footnote-2)</sup>
Barts father always told him that he regretted practicing medicine, because his patients would not what he recommended (like becoming a vegetarian, taking cold showers in the morning, exercise..).
He said if he could start over, he would become a writer. At this point in life Bart decided to give up within the profession and become an independent teacher and do his science on his own. He also never graduated because he failed an exam. 

His discoveries where never recognized in the profession. In that time, the the concept of expanded consciousness was unknown and not a subject that was studied. Huges had long been interested in trepanation as a method to overcome psychological problems and reach a higher level of consciousness. His theory was based on the concept that an infant's supposedly higher state of consciousness is related to its unsealed skull, which allows the brain to expand freely and thus the cerebral blood flow and metabolism. As we grow older, the bones of the skull grow together and the flow is restricted, additionally due to our upright posture. Huges successfully trepaned himself with an electric drill on 6 January 1965. He affirmed the beneficial effects were immediate: his consciousness was sharpened and his neuroses were overcome. 

![Bart Hughes trepanating himself](https://github.com/BoboSchlonz/HoleInTheHeadBobo/blob/master/documentation/images/huges-trepanation1b-219x300.jpg)


He began to preach about trepanation and started publishing documents about it. His first publication was a scroll, named "The Mechanism of Brainbloodvolume ('BBV')" (also known as "Homo Sapiens Correctus") in 1964. In this he explained his theory, that because of mans upright position, the sealed cranial sutures and the fact that blood is heavier than cerebrospinal fluid, the brailbloodvolume decreases. This leads to a slowed down brainmetabolism and diminishing of creativity, originality and youth. In his theory, trepanation could be used to enhance brain functionality by balancing the proportion of blood and cerebral spinal fluid. He also introduces several other methods to increase cerebral blood flow, such as jumping, the transition from a hot tub to a cold one, yoga headstand or the use of psychoactive drugs ("psychovitamins"), with Trepanation allowing a lasting increase in blood volume and restoring pulsation and metabolism as a result of increased cranial compliance. 
The publication "Trepanation the cure for psychosis" which was publicated in 1970 was another collection if his ideas and a complete overview on how to expand ones mind through trepanation and how to prevent or treat psychosis with it.

#### Amanda Feilding
Amanda Feilding met Bart Hughes in 1966 and he got her interested in trepanation. She said: *“Bart quite changed my viewpoint, opening up doors of science and biology to me. He was very charismatic, we had a great love affair, and I was curious to see if what he said was true.”* <sup>[[3]](#footnote-3)</sup> After meeting Bart she spent four years loking for a surgeon to trepan her. She had no success with that search and ended up trepaning herself in 1970, she was 27 years old. To dissasociate herself from her body and the procedure she decided to film the process and treat the whole procedure like an art project. This film is titled "Heartbeat in the Brain", shows her shaving her hairline, putting on a floral shower cap to keep back her remaining hair, making a mask out of sunglasses and medical tape, injecting herself with a local anesthetic, and peeling back a patch of skin with a scalpel. With a look of determined, almost trance-like concentration, Feilding then holds a dentist’s drill to her head and, pressing the foot pedal that operates it, begins to push it into the frontal bone. Her self-trepanation is successfull and only takes about 20 minutes. The film ends with her bandaging her head and mopping up the blood from her face with water and cotton wool. She changes out of her bloody tunic into a colorful Moroccan kaftan and wraps a shimmering gold turban around her head to disguise the bandages. Looking glamorous, bohemian, and elated, she smiles goodbye to the camera and heads off to a fancy-dress party. 
Over the years, she only showed the movie to small, selected audiences, as she is aware that this operation is dangerous and better performed by a doctor and has risks. The reason for filming the procedure was not to glamourize it, but to dissasociate herself from her body by treating the operation like an art project.

Amanda Feilding is still alive today and she is still active in the fields of drug research, psychoactive drugs and consciousness raising. In 1998 she founded the Foundation to Further Consciousness, later renamed to the Beckley Foundation, a non-profit foundation that initiates, leads and supports neuroscientific and clinical research on the effects of psychoactive substances on the brain and perception. She co-authored over 50 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. <sup>[[4]](#footnote-4)</sup> The central aim of her research is to find new treatment options for mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and addiction, and to explore methods to increase well-being and creativity. 
She stood for Parliament as an independent candidate in her local constituency of Chelsea, England in 1979 and 1983, campaigning on the sole platform that trepanation should be freely available on the National Health Service.

Feilding is a supporter of the procedure to this day, althogh she is open to doubt: *"If it is a placebo effect, I’d love to know, then one can just draw a line under that subject and see it as a kind of cultural artwork. I still have a burning ambition to discover what the truth is. But from my own experience I think there is a change, otherwise I wouldn’t be bothering about it forty years later.”* <sup>[[3]](#footnote-3)</sup> 

#### Joseph Mellen
Joseph or Joey Mellen first met Bart Huges in Ibiza and became a close friend and follower. After some years talking  about trepanation, he decided to act. In fact, he tried to trepan himself four times. The first two attempts had been unsuccessfull, he had no previous medical expierience and used a manual corkscrew bought in a surgical store. He also took some LSD during both attempts. After the first unsuccessful attempt, he asked for the help of Amanda Feilding, but at the final moment he fainted. He finally succeeded in completing the trepanation in his third attempt soon after.<sup>[[5]](#footnote-5)</sup> 
*"After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling. I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued. It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out. I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it. At last! On closer inspection I saw that the disc of bone was much deeper on one side than on the other. Obviously the trepan had not been straight and had gone through at one point only, then the piece of bone had snapped off and come out. I was reluctant to start drilling again for fear of damaging the brain membranes with the deeper part while I was cutting through the rest or of breaking off a splinter. If only I had an electric drill it would have been so much simpler. Amanda was sure I was through. There seemed no other explanation for the schlurping noises I decided to call it a day. At the time I thought that any hole would do, no matter what size. I bandaged up my head and cleared away the mess."* <sup>[[6]](#footnote-6)</sup> 

He was still doubting if he had really broken through and, if so, whether the hole was big enough to restore pulsation to his brain. So in 1970, he made a second hole, this time with an electric drill. *"This time I was not in any doubt. The drill head went at least an inch deep through the hole. A great gush of blood followed my withdrawal of the drill. In the mirror I could see the blood in the hole rising and falling with the pulsation of the brain."*<sup>[[6]](#footnote-6)</sup> 
The result was all he had hoped for. During the next four hours he felt his spirits rising higher until he reached a state of freedom and serenity which he claims, has been with him ever since.

Joey Mellen wrote a book about his experiences called "Bore Hole" that was reissued in 2015.<sup>[[6]](#footnote-6)</sup>

### Significance Today
During my research, I expanded my research and started to focus on the unrecognized abilites of the human body. In western society and medicine there is a strong separation of the perception of body and mind, if something like "mind" is perceived at all.  Only very slowly there is a change in the perception of the brain as a kind of computer and the body as a peripheral device. 
Approaching the human as a logic and rational thing limits the possibilies of healing, self-awareness and contact to the self. The approach of Bart Hughes and the people around him is still interesting because it shifts the boundaries of the body and questions taboos. 

#### Psychedelics in therapeutical settings
In Western cultures, psychedelic drugs have a negative image in society as a whole and are rather attributed to partying. 
But there is a further interest in research developing around this topic. Bbesides the already mentioned Beckley Foundation, which was founded by Amanda Feilding, there are several other research groups in Europe and America, which study the effects and safety of psychedelics on mental health conditions. It is essential to mention the [Imperial Centre for Psychedelic Research](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/psychedelic-research-centre/), which is the first research group to gain a solid level of stature within a major academic institution, the Imperial College London.
It was the first Centre worldwide to research the effects of LSd on the brain by using modern brain imaging and the frist to study psilocybin – the active compound in magic mushrooms – for treating severe depression. These studies have laid the groundwork for larger trials that are now taking place around the world. Other pioneering work from the group includes breakthrough neuroimaging research with psilocybin, MDMA and DMT (the psychoactive compounds found in ecstasy and ayahuasca respectively).<sup>[[7]](#footnote-7)</sup> 
They published many papers and articles showing studies that psychedelic therapy is very promising for treating some very serious mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), showing a change in personality structure and brain complexity, which can be helpful for patients suffering from treatment‐resistant depression (TRD)<sup>[[8]](#footnote-8)</sup> <sup>[[9]](#footnote-9)</sup> 

Apart from these studies and research centres, the positive effect of psychedelics can be experienced in therapeutical settings legally in some countries (like the Netherlands or Jamaica, where Magif truffels are legal). These retreats usually offer a 2-4 day programme and a supervised intake of psychedelics. Teams offering those structures consist often of a broad range of people with focus on psychotherapy, body-psychotherapy, traditional chinese medicine, trauma, voice, shamanic traditions, biology, yoga, breath work and music. 


#### Breathwork, Meditation and Yoga
We need explanations and proofs. Humans are striving to expand their consciousness, to get high in some way. There are various methods to influence the body and mind itself with external influences. But besides the extreme method of trepanation and other methods to change the actual state by external factors, there are also tools for this, which do not require any external influences, but which take place within the individual. In the West we find it hard to believe in anything if it’s not proven in research. Science makes things real.
There are a vast number of methods to reach the mind, brain and body that have been practiced for thousands of years. Little by little there is also interest in the West and there is a growing open-mindedness towards these methods. Meanwhile, there is also a lot of research and studies on yoga, cold immersion, breathing techniques and natural movement, all of which are available completely free of costs and which only need your body to be performed. 

When the mind is calm and happy, everything else falls into place. To reach the mind we can hack into our immune system and consciously influence our stress response. 


## Transcoding
My aim or approach to the transcoding is for one, the processing and visualisation of the found material of Bart Hughes' theories. I also want to focus on the unrecognized abilities of the human body, whether it is survival with a hole in the skull, or getting high on endogenous drugs through breathing techniques. 

### Digitalisation of the book
Only a very small ammount of the written book is digitalized. It was not published in large numbers and there is no source to digitally find this book. My aim was to make it accessable online. I wanted to keep the original feeling of a book, So I cleaned scanned pages of the book up and made the pages better readable.


#### Methods
Scanning the pages of the book and edit them in a way they are readable in Photoshop.

### Transcoding 3
#### Poster 

#### Aims
showing the variety of possibilities to mind-expansion

#### Results


## Transcoding Tool


#### Aims
I wanted to make something that one can experience. I would have loved to do this in a performance/a performed ritual that one can join and experience live. But with the new situation, I had to adjust a bit, so that still everyone who wants to can join, but not face to face.

#### Methods
Filming, Premiere Pro, 

#### Results
A guided breathing-exercise. It's possible to use the video I made at any time to experience the breathwork-method and it stands for what I might have been doing if the school wasn't closed.
